## B2R
This was my fourth project as a 42 student and my last to complete the fisrt circle.

**We will need to create our first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. 
Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.**

## Grade
> This project got a **125**/100 in **_42_** school
